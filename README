Canvas Sunset

A simple experiment aimed at creating a sunset scene entirely in <canvas>

Looking to speed up the wave reflection engine, and then will add clouds, birds, and landscape.

Move your mouse around to fly my blue testing ball.

By far the best browser to view this in is Opera 10.60+. Very fast FPS and the gradients are silky smooth.

In order from fastest to slowest: Webkit Nightlies/Safari 5, Chromium/Chrome, Firefox.

Haven't been able to test hardware acceleration or IE9 on my Mac yet. :(
